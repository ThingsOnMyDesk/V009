You wander off into a discreet area to relieve yourself.

You start to remove your diaper.

"Excuse me." Mary Says. "What do you think you're doing?"
You explain the situation.

"No no no. As I explained before, only I remove your diaper
and only for the sole purpose of changing you. That was the rule. 
Do you understand?"

"Well how am I supposed to relieve myself?"

"You're wearing a diaper aren't you?"

You stare in disbelief. Eventually you reply.
"Fine, but can I at least have some privacy?"

"No. I have to make sure you won't cheat."

"I can't go with you watching."

"Then I guess you didn't really have to relieve yourself."
