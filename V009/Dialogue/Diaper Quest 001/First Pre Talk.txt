As you approach the noise a mountain lion jumps out at you!

You try to fight it off with your dagger but its no match for the mountain lion.

Just when you think all hope is lost, you hear the mountain lion howel 
and then fall off of you.

The mountain lion has stopped moving. You see a tall, thick woman with a 
broad sword standing over you.

She has killed the beast. She asks if you're okay and why you were out in
her backyard.

"Adventuring you say? Without a weapon?"
You show her your dagger. She laughs.

"Sweetie that is no weapon. If you want to be a real adventurer, nay if 
you want to be a real man,you need a big weapon. And that dinky thing, 
that baby sword of yours, will never penetrate anyone. Look at that itty bitty thing.
It's so shiny. I bet you polish your sword alot. Have you visited 
the shop? Too expensive you say? Yeah that sounds about right."

She gets a funny glint in her eye. 

"Say, how would you like my sword? I'm more of a mage anyway.
All you have to do, is wear a special garmet for me for one week. 
Sound easy enough?" 

You initially agree. I'm glad you think so."

She brings out a diaper.

"Wear this for me for one week, and the sword is yours. What do you say?"

Agree to wear the diaper for one week?
