V. 4 Objectives:
Because we had a massive overhaul, Plans for v004 and v005 were combined.

We encountered an unexpected error where DQ and FQ intersected. Make sure to do extra testing.

Add 3 new Quests:
	1. Deliver a message to someone in a different area. (Too complex)
	2. Fight a strong opponent. R. Discount at shop.
	3. Remove a ghost ==> find note on dead body (Maybe imply he ate someone) 
	==> Deliver to a grieving woman.
 
	4. Solve a Riddle?
	5. Burn a building for revenge?
     ==>6. Kill a witch ==> Mary. ==> Decide to stop it or let it go.

Add 3 new Dynamic things: (Complete quest ==> Get companion ==> Companion weighs in, in decision making or helps you get a better deal)
	
	1. (Complete) Lost Girl ==> Suggests Blow Job to hungry girl.
	2. If you have sword from diaper ==> Strong opponent weak


V3 Fixes/Edits:
	(Complete) Maybe DiaperConditions bool for first attempt. use restroom.

	and/or go to relevant sublocation.
