Possible win conditions:
1. Defeat a great evil - encouraged sissy
	-Thong of agility, etc.
2. Complete 5 quests. <- Too easy. But maybe for testing purposes. Later we can make it like 10. Also quest has to actually succeed. (i.e. Kayla joining party fails quest)
3. Have Sex with 4 Girls. <-Too easy, maybe like 8(Not necessesarily party members (Think food girl))
4. 

What if, each playthrough, one get's disqualified. i.e. after you defeat great evil, that doesn't count anymore. - Each win condition gave a seperate unlock. <- Mm. I don't know if I like that


3a. - Kayla-Futaworld + snake bite, Mary, Food Girl, Doctor(not to be confused with nurse) (SpitRoast Kayla+Mary)
