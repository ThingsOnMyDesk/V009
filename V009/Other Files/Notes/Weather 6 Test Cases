Sleep on Beach, ==> talk to guy who wants Ocean Sprouts. Can you still interact with Beach? Should he even be there in the first place?
	man shows up, but can't be found after

If you remove your diaper does quest fail? == Maybe need a restructure
	There was an issue with this. We need a clear guide on what functions exist within parent class, which functions are overriden, and which exist to sub classes.

If you sleep until DQ complete what happens when you go to the beach.
Fixed

Does the man only appear in the appropriate place, or does he follow you everywhere.
Fixed this issue.

Bugs.
	Total days in diaper != consec. (I don't know what I did, I can't recreate this yet. It might have something to do with, "Relieve yourself," text block. It might also be an interact issue)

	DQ is started, Lost girl can be interacted with.
