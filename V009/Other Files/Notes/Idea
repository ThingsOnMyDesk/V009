Party members need to have certain properties to activate certain quests inspiring replayability.

For example, if lifeguard is lesbian, she can bring a particular individual back to life with kiss. (Think like "True love's kiss" type of thing.)

Maybe each playthrough unlocks certain things:
	Singular playthrough - Rename Girl
	Secondary playthrough - Save/ Load certain girls (or replace 1 girl)
	Third playthrough - Unlock race, special body types, etc.
	Fourth playthrough - Customize physical atributes of characters
	Fifth playthrough - Customize all attributes
